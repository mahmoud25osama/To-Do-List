# To-Do List

A simple, clean, and intuitive web-based **To-Do List application** built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.
It allows you to add, complete, and delete tasks—with **persistent storage** using `localStorage`, so your tasks remain even after refreshing or closing the browser.

## Features

* **Add tasks** with the input field.
* **Mark tasks as complete** (toggle completed state).
* **Remove tasks** you no longer need.
* **Persistent storage**: Tasks are saved in your browser using `localStorage`.
